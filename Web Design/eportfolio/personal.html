            <h3>Critical Thinking and Problem Solving</h3>
            <p>I believe critical thinking and problem solving is one of my strongest points, I have many years of experience when it comes to this as I have been programming from a very young age. I have done many different python projects some including the Raspberry Pi and I have lots of experience in vb.net. Doing all these programming projects has helped my develop my problem solving skills tremendously.</p>
            <h3>Professionalism</h3>
            <p>When it comes to professionalism I have good time management skills and am able to manage my work efficiently in order to meet deadlines, this makes me a more reliable individual. I also make sure I complete all work to a high standard as I believe it is important to put 100% effort into everything I do.</p>
            <h3>Communication Skills</h3>
            <p>I enjoy working together with others to complete tasks and this has led to my having good communication skills, I am also a very social person spending my free time with others.</p>
            <h3>Teamwork and Leadership</h3>
            <p>I have the essential team work and leadership skills which I developed during my time working over the summer at Lalehams Heath and Beauty, I spent most of my time there working in teams to solve issues on the production line, I was in charge of making sure my team worked efficiently and everyone was doing the correct job.</p>
            <h3>Learning and Research Skills</h3>
            <p>During my time in Alton College I wrote many different essays for my Physics A-Level course, this has lead to me having lots of practice in my reserach skills; However, I still believe I have alot to improve on when it comes to researching, during my time in University I would like to improve this skill.</p>
