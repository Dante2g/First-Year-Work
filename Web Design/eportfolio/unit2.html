            <h3>Introduction to Web Design and Development</h3>
            <p>This unit focuses on teaching us the basics and fundementals of web design, so far I have learnt how to use HTML 5, semantic tags amd also how to create a style sheet to link to the HTML 5 pages. I have used these skills so far to develop this ePortfolio. </p>
            <h3>Information Systems (IS) & Databases</h3>
            <p>In Information Systems we look at Organisations, Systems Analysis and Desifn and IS in Organisations. So far we have started a group project in which we have completed the first part, during this we look at an example case study for 'Ray's Rentals' and analysed the current system he had in place, then we came up with some management reports and data enquiries that could be used.</p>
